**Console Vcard Converter**<br>
This is a console vcard converter, designed to convert Android contact list to a readable format.<br>
Build it with Maven and use the resulting .jar file and a "lib/" directory together.<br>
<br>
**How to use it**<br>
The program consumes 2 parameters: <br>
`<full_path_to_vcf> <export_format>`,<br>
where `<full_path_to_vcf>` is a full path to a vcard file and `<export_format>` is a format you want to export to.<br>
For now there are two formats available: .txt and .docx. Later, a new functionality may be added.<br>
Anyway, you are free to improve it.<br>
